I don't know how github works. 

This code takes the stuff that timothyng-164 did here: https://github.com/timothyng-164/tachiyomi/tree/1977-auto-rotate and updates it to a more recent version of the main tachiyomi branch. I did this because timothyng-164's version, once compiled, didn't let me use extensions. Don't know why that is, don't really care to know, but now that it's updated this version works with extensions. This is my first and hopefully last encounter with android studio.

I won't touch this unless extensions break again for some reason.
